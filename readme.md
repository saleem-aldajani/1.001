# Elastic Ball Simulation

## Overview
This project is an interactive simulation where users can create elastic balls by clicking inside a bounded container. The balls move with random initial velocities, bounce off the walls, and collide elastically with each other. Users can control the simulation parameters such as time step, gravity, and elasticity using sliders.

## Features
- Click inside the container to generate a new ball.
- Balls bounce off the walls and interact with each other.
- Adjustable time step to control simulation speed.
- Adjustable gravity to modify the downward force applied to the balls.
- Adjustable elasticity to determine the energy retained in collisions.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click inside the simulation area to create bouncing balls.
3. Adjust the sliders to modify the behavior of the simulation:
   - **Time Step**: Changes the speed of the simulation.
   - **Gravity**: Controls the downward pull on the balls.
   - **Elasticity**: Determines how much energy is retained during collisions.

## Technologies Used
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity and physics simulation

## Future Enhancements
- Add ball size variation.
- Implement color-coded velocity visualization.
- Allow users to remove specific balls.
- Improve collision physics for more realistic interactions.
